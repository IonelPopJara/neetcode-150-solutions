## LeetCode

To make it easier for myself, I used the extension [leetcode.nvim](https://github.com/kawre/leetcode.nvim) created by [kawre](https://github.com/kawre). This extension allows you to solve leetcode challenges inside Neovim.

## Changelog

Orignally, this repo contained the solutions for the problems presented in the book _Craking the Coding Interview_. However, after solving a few, I decided to go with _NeetCode 150_ because the structure seemed easier to understand.
